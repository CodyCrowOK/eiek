# eiek

A GUI wrapper for eie, specifically the eie that's located in the eie-c repository.

eiek is written entirely using Perl and the Tkx CPAN module, which is a terrific Tcl/Tk wrapper.

Currently, it works on Linux and in all likelihood other Unix-likes, but it almost certainly will not work on Windows, unless you run it on cygwin; even then, good luck.
